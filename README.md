# 🧱 Frontend Mentor – Basic Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to basic HTML/CSS challenges from the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) platform.
Each project is placed in its own folder and designed as a **standalone static page** with its own SCSS and output to `dist/`.

The repository serves as a **practice space**, but also as a **modular portfolio** – each project can be easily deployed individually, e.g., via Netlify.

**📝 Summary:**  
A fully responsive landing page built with semantic HTML and modular SCSS.  
This challenge focused on replicating the provided Figma design across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints while maintaining a clean BEM-based structure, consistent spacing and typography, and an accessible implementation using semantic tags (`header`, `main`, `section`, `h1–h2`, `p`, `img`) with appropriate `alt`, `aria-label`, and `aria-hidden` attributes.

## 🚀 Technologies used

- **HTML5 + BEM**
- **SCSS** – each project has its own isolated SCSS
- **Vite** – central compilation via `package.json` scripts
- **Node.js skripty** – for creating and building projects
- (optional) **Netlify** – deploy each project individually

---

## 📦 Working with the project

### Install dependencies (only once in the root)

```bash
npm install
```

### Create a new project

```bash
npm run init <nazev-projektu>
```

This creates a new folder, e.g., `faq-accordion`, clones the template, removes `package.json` inside, and updates the central `package.json` with new `sass:` scripts.

### Run `qr` project in dev mode

```bash
npm run dev:qr
```

### Build `qr` project

```bash
npm run build:qr
```

### Preview `qr` project

```bash
npm run preview:qr
```

---

## 🌐 Deployment on Netlify

Each project can be deployed individually - e.g., the folder `qr-code-component/`.

**Build command:** *(none - build locally)*  
**Publish directory:** `qr-code-component`

Make sure that `index.html` links to the CSS file in `./dist/style.css`.

---

## 🧠 Project goals

- Revisiting and practice a clean HTML + SCSS + [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/) approach
- Keep **each project independent**, but with centralized build
- Create clean and easily deployable outputs
- Automate folder creation and compilation with Node.js

---

## 📌 Notes

- Each project has its own folder - no SCSS is shared between them.
- The central `package.json` contains all build/watch scripts.
- Scripts are generated automatically via `scripts/init-project.js`.
