This is my solution for the [QR code component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H) challenge from Frontend Mentor.  
The goal was to create a simple, centered QR code card component that closely matches the provided Figma design, using semantic HTML and modern SCSS practices.

## 🛠 Technologies used

- HTML5 + BEM naming convention
- SCSS with `@use` and modular structure
- Flexbox + aspect-ratio for layout and scaling
- Decorative elements with `::before` / `::after`
- Manual SCSS build (no framework)

## ✨ What I focused on

- A deliberately minimalist project where I focused on a consistent HTML and SCSS structure
- Using a modern SCSS approach with `@use`, variables and component modularity
- Maintaining visual fidelity of the design in Figma, including subtle shadows and backgrounds with decorative circles
- Working with `aspect-ratio` to maintain proper QR box ratio across devices
- Consistent use of BEM naming and clean layout without relying on JS or CSS frameworks

---

## 🧠 Key implementation notes

- The design for desktop and mobile used an identical component - I decided not to use media queries because they were not needed
- Box-shadow and spacings were exactly replicated according to Figma specifications, including opacity conversion (e.g. `4.77%` to `rgba`)
- Decorative circles in the background were implemented via pseudo-elements with absolute positioning
- The font "Outfit" was loaded via Google Fonts and plugged in as a SCSS variable for possible scalability in other components
- Paying attention to accessibility through semantic HTML (e.g., `h1`, `p`, `img` with `alt`) and proper document language declaration
